# AsteroidsBot
Autonomous asteroid dodging machine!

## Motivation

On top of a simple implementation of Asteroids written in Python using the PyGame library, I have created a bot that dodges asteroids!  I have found that my favorite subjects to study have consistently revolved around real-time decision making since it combines mathematical modeling and high-performance computing toward a goal of automating a complex task.  What especially excites me about projects in automated decision making such as this is that with a robust implementation, the results will often far surpass the capabilities of a human performing the same task.
